# Git and Gitflow Workshop
<!-- Created by [Alyssa Graham](https://github.com/agraham0925) and [Marie Trull](https://github.com/marietrull) to help web development students practice the gitflow process in a team setting. -->

## Setup
* Students should be broken into groups of 3-4 people. Assign each person a number.
* 1's should fork the repo from the main repo. 1's should then add the other students in their group as collaborators to their forked repo.
* All students should then clone the repo to their machines after they're added as collaborators.
